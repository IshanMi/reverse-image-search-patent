# reverse-image-search-patent
<h6><b> The Problem </b></h6>

A frustration I've had in the past when conducting patent searches was that regular search only 
went so far.
This is due to a number of reasons, such as patents being poorly translated from other languages, or due to 
intentionally broad and non-specific language being used to broaden the scope of the patent.

However, I often noticed that the patent drawings were usually quite accurate, often times either being drawn by a 
professional, or by using commercial CAD software. I then wanted to try to implement reverse image search to identify
 similar patents by searching using prior art.

I found a link <a href='https://sagaciousresearch.com/blog/patent-searching-through-reverse-image-search/'>  here </a> 

One thing I'd love to try is to reach out to other reverse image search engines and see how this app could be improved.

TO DO:

> Implementing the second API to download patents locally

> Setting up a searchable database for these downloaded patents

> Writing a class where each patent is stored as an instance

As a bonus:

> Rendering HTML to make the website look beautiful

> deploying it to an actual url, maybe using Github Pages
